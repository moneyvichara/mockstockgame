By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced when the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including but not limited to performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

h. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, Public Display, Public Performance, Distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public so that members of the public may access it from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your and Yours have a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

2. The license is granted for the duration of the Copyright and Similar Rights in the Licensed Material.

3. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as a limitation upon any Exceptions and Limitations to Copyright and Similar Rights that may apply to Your use of the Licensed Material.

4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as a grant of rights under a trademark or patent.

5. However, if the Licensor is also a patent holder, then this license is also subject to the following condition: the Licensor grants You a royalty-free license under any patents the Licensor owns or controls that are essential to enable the use of the Licensed Material under this license.

6. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights in Sui Generis Database Rights, trademarks, and patents.

b. Other rights, warranties and disclaimers.

1. Sui Generis Database Rights. If the Licensed Material is a database, and the Licensor holds Sui Generis Database Rights, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

2. No warranty. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
